            <p>We were not close enough to here the lamentation of the women, but they did flee before us, and we definetly crushed them.
            However you feel about that for an active duty Marine in a combat zone the crushing and fleeing really are what is best in life.
            I was with Romeo Battery 5th Battalion 11th Marine Regiment in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the night I want to tell you about
            is when we provided support for the initial push into Baghdad.
            <br>There are a couple of f-bombs in the below video and it is not the same fire mission but is a good representation of what we did over there.

            <p>At approximately 3 am local time we got the call to do a regimental fire mission, that means that every gun in the regiment fires
            Now there are 5 or 6 guns in a battery, and there were 5 batteries deployed with 11th Marines in OIF so there were 
            around 30 155mm artillery pieces firing at once. We were instructed to fire all of our RAP rounds, Rocket Assisted Projectiles, with our max charge of powder.
            At a specific altitude there is a rocket that fires in the base of the round and propel it farther than a normal round would go. It looked like this, footage from that mission</p>

            <p>I don't know if I can put into words how it felt that night, lighting up the sky and laying down rounds for our ground units pushing into the city.<br>
            However, it was like Conan said. "Best in life" </p>

            <p>P.S. Props if you can find me in the top pic!!</p>
